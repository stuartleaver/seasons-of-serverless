# What is Seasons of Serverless

Mes chers amis,

Every year, we all look forward to our annual holiday potluck. From jollof rice all across West Africa to Indian ladoos to celebrate Diwali, sharing our favorite foods and traditions is our favorite part of the season!

Of course, we know that's not possible this year, so we've come up with an alternative: a virtual code challenge potluck! Each week, someone in our community is going to post a unique code challenge exploring a recipe and a food for all of our friends to solve. It may not be the same as breaking bread in-person or smelling and tasting your flavorful creations, but hopefully these delectable brain-teasers can still give us a taste of each other's traditions.

Grosses bises, Dominique et Simone
